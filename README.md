🎹 Easy Piano Note System

A new piano notation system where you don’t need to learn all the traditional notes.
Designed to make piano learning easier, faster, and more enjoyable — especially for beginners and visual learners.

🌱 Why this system?

In the normal system, you need to memorize every single note on the sheet before you can play.
With this system, you only need to learn 7 main notes — after that, the pattern repeats,
just like on a real piano.

⚙️ How it works

A piano has 88 keys, but they follow a repeating 7-note pattern:
C D E F G A B

This system uses the same 7 main notes, but visually repeats them after each octave.
That means once you understand the first set,
you can instantly read any note on the keyboard — no matter how high or low.

🎵 “Learn 7 notes — play 88 keys.”

💡 Why it helps

Many people would love to play the piano,
but give up early because reading notes feels too hard.
This system makes reading simple, logical, and visually intuitive.

My first piece I learned was “Sweden” (by C418 from Minecraft).
It covers nearly half the piano’s range,
and yet it was easy to read and play thanks to this system.

🧭 Vision

I want this to be open source, freely available, and
used for learning and creativity — to make music more accessible for everyone.
Everything is shared freely, with no ads, and open for community contribution.

“To the glory of God — that more people may find joy in music.”

How to convert notes:
1) Find the piano sheet of your song: 
https://musescore.com/?srsltid=AfmBOopwBU-Ge4U0zAtVZECAhcQGqeg1QR5qg3Fe9DkHttrLMt9-fVYq&utm_source=chatgpt.com
2) Download the MusicXML file.
3) Rename the ordner as .zip
4) Open it. The Internet-Explorer file you can pull out.
5) Open it with an "Editor"
6) Save it as .musicxml   (dont select .txt but "all files")
7) give it to ChatGPT and say this Prompt:
      “Convert this MusicXML file into Notecode —
      both hands combined,
      right hand uppercase, left hand lowercase,
      simultaneous notes connected with ‘+’,
      sorted from top to bottom,
      each note or chord on a new line,
      and one empty line between measures.”
8) The "Notecode" you can than feed to the program "Note Converter."
     It outputs a long picture, so it´s currently just for screens, and not for print out.
